/*If you want to serialize the ArrayList object to a file so you can read it back in again later 
use ObjectOuputStream/ObjectInputStream writeObject()/readObject() since ArrayList implements 
Serializable. It's not clear to me from your question if you want to do this or just write each 
individual item*/
